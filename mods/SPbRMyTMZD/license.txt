YouTube Notes:

Beating the Algorithm:

3-part equation:
	perfect retention
	not about cuts/talking
	put cool info in first minute
	use establishing shots
		set scene
		wow viewer
			start challenge ASAP
		post Intro problem:
			tension usually dies quickly
				make sure this isn't the case
Mr Beast:			
	limits videos at 1080p
	doesn't let tension die
	cool finally
	clickbait:
		facial expression
			eye color
		
		micro details	
		balance of colors
			realistic
			setting a scale
			
		simplicity


	is insane with marketing (perks)
	
his business it mission driven

It's a necessity to use clickbait but do it WELL.
