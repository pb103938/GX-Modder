So you know how at the end of the book, Morus says he would "Rather hope than wish" to see certain things from Utopia implemented in Western Civilization?

Well, standalone, it sounds like he's saying that they sound good, but would be bad in reality 

BUT

When the context of the statement is considered, another conclusion can be drawn

When the prior context is brought in, the statement is: 
"I cannot perfectly agree to everything he had related. However, are many things in the commonwealth of Utopia that I rather wish, than hope, to see followed in our governments."
It can be argued, them, that the statement "I rather wish, than hope" means something we haven't fully considered.

It, supposedly, means that he wishes that certain things would be implemented, but cannot hope for it, because of the reality of Western Civilization's government.

It'd be like me saying, I wish that the government would use some of our taxes to help poor people, but because of reality, I really can't hope it will happen, because the chances of it are very low, and I don't have enough power and/or influence to propose it without being ridiculed.
